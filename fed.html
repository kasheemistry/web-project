    <h2>How to stay fed</h2>
    <h3> From our experince cooking can be very difficult for students; knowing what to cook, how to cook it, and the long time it takes are just a few of the reasons that put us off from cooking. </h3>
    <h3> Eating 3 healthy (and proper) meals a day is essential to getting enough energy to cope with the demands of being a student, so here's some handy information in making cooking a lot easier and more manageable.</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Well, pasta is a uni stdents' best friend: it's versatile, easy to make and very cheap! It also requires little cooking skills.</li>
  <li>We'd also recommend buying some brown bread which is high in fibre and is the perfect solution for lunchtime and easy to eat on the go!</li>
  <li>Baked beans is the perfect comfort food, super easy to cook in the microwave and can be eaten with pretty much anything.</li>
  <li>Next up: Protein. A lot of students cut meat out, either because its too expensive or they just don't know what to do with it.  We'd recommend buying multipacks of chicken breast because it is cheaper, and breast meat is lean and requires less cooking time (ideal for busy students!) If you are vegetarian, ignore what we have just said, and some great alternatives are chickpeas, lentils or eggs.</li>
  <li>And finally, vegetables.  They have become something of a myth amongst students.  To save money, we'd recommend frozen packets of vegetables, which are equally delicious and just as fresh!  We've bought frozen green beans, peas and mixed vegetables and they make perfect side dishes (and ensure you get your vitamins!) </li>
</ul>
