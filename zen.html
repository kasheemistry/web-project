<h2> Finding your Zen</h2>
<h3>We understand that uni can be very intense and very stressful, which is why it's so important to look after your mental health. Here is a guide on ways you can make sure of that: </h3>

<ol>
  <li> Make sure to incorporate activities you love into your schedule, whether it's something as simple as reading a novel, gaming, or painting...whatever it is, make some time to unwind and relax. It will help you destress and ultinately stay happy and focused while at uni! </li>

  <li> Exercise! We know that may not sound like fun to some of you, but there are so many crucial benefits to exercise; it lifts our mood, keeps us fit, and let's us work off stress. Exercise does't have to be a boring routine, you could try out something new: join a sports society for example. </li>

    <br>

  <li> Make sure to socialise. There are so many benefits to talking to other students, from sharing your experience, going to uni events together, and collaborating with course mates. Uni can be a daunting experience for everyone, and talking to people can make that less scary, and you might find people you share common interests with!  </li>
